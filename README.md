# AWS Builder Challenge #2 – Build a Website on the Cloud

## Project Overview
This repository documents my journey through the **AWS Builder Challenge #2: Build a Website on the Cloud** —a 7-day guided experience where I deployed a secure, globally distributed website and integrated serverless features using AWS.

## Challenge Journey (Day-by-Day)

| Day | What I Did |
|-----|------------|
| **Day 1** | Created IAM user, enabled MFA, and set up budget alerts for account security. |
| **Day 2** | Configured an Amazon S3 bucket and uploaded site files (HTML, CSS, images). |
| **Day 3** | Developed website content (front-end build with HTML, CSS, profile image). |
| **Day 4** | Distributed the website globally using Amazon CloudFront with HTTPS enabled. |
| **Day 5** | Automated deployments via AWS Amplify connected to GitHub. |
| **Day 6** | Built a contact form (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Connected it with **Amazon SNS** and a **Python Lambda function** so submissions are emailed directly to me. |
| **Day 7** | Wrote documentation (blog post + README) to reflect on the project and share with others. |

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Hosting**: Amazon S3  
- **Distribution**: Amazon CloudFront (with HTTPS)  
- **Security**: IAM, MFA, Budget Alerts  
- **Automation**: AWS Amplify + GitHub  
- **Serverless**: Amazon SNS + AWS Lambda (Python) for contact form  
- **Docs**: Blog post + README

## Lessons Learned
- **Cloud security is step one**—IAM and MFA aren’t optional.  
- **Static sites can be powerful** when combined with global distribution.  
- **Serverless architecture** makes adding dynamic features (like contact forms) simple and scalable.  
- **Documentation is part of development**—it’s how learning becomes reusable.
